#include "tests.h"

TEST("Test Name") {
	assert(1 == 1);
	asserteq(1 + 1, 2);
	assertmemeq(&(int) { 0x2 }, { 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x2 });
	assertstreq("hi", "hi");

## âœ¨ Features

- [x] Works in MSVC, MinGW, GCC, and any other compiler that supports `__COUNTER__`.
- [x] â†³ No need to copy every test function name into "suites" and/or other BS.
- [x] Clean test output with fully featured timing.
- [x] **Microbenchmarks** alongside tests!!!
- [x] Properly and easily allows you to name tests and parts of tests.
- [x] Simple and clean to use.
- [x] **Catches SIGSEGVs** and other signals without stopping the tests, properly failing the appropriate test and subtest.

## ðŸ§° Usage

1. Put `#include <tests.h>` at the start of your file before all other imports.
2. Put `#include <tests_end.h>` at the very end of your file.

> **Note**
> `tests.h` imports `stdio.h` automatically. You don't need to import it again to use IO.

## ðŸ“– API

- `TEST("Test name") {}`: Defines a test.
- `assert(bool passed)`: A check performed per test.
	- `asserteq(any_num_type n1, any_num_type n2)`: Can use any type of number for arguments, including Enums.
	- `assertmemeq()`
- `SUB("Subtest name") {}`: Defines the start of a "subtest". This is a part of the test that is also individually timed
	- This resets the timer so any previous actions between subtests will not be timed.
- **Advanced:**
	- `INIT() { /* code */ }`: Defines an initializer function, run before all tests and untimed.

## Demo

This was used for the graphic above, with the command `gcc example.c -o example.exe && example`.

```c
#include <string.h>
#include "tests.h"

char* str;

// Defines an init function that runs before all tests and doesn't get timed. INIT {} also works fine.
INIT() {
	str = malloc(sizeof(char) * 51);
	str[50] = 0;
}

// Tests are started with TEST("Test Name") {}
TEST("Asserts") {
	assert(1 + 1 == 2);
	asserteq(1 + 1, 2.0f);
}

// Tests with subtests are different from normal tests with just asserts - Only the contents of the subtest are timed.
TEST("Subtests") {
	char* setup = malloc(2000); // This is not timed.
	
	SUB("Subtraction") { assert(2 - 1 == 1); }
	SUB("Multiplication") {
		assert(1 * 2 == 2);
		asserteq(2 * 1, 2);
	}
	free(setup); // Not timed.
}

// This test is built to catch SIGSEGVs
TEST("Signal Catching") {
	SUB("Proper access") { assert(str[10]); }
	SUB("Access Violation") { assert(str[60000]); }
}

#include "tests_end.h"
```

> **Note** 
> Any `assert`s before a subtest count for that subtest.
